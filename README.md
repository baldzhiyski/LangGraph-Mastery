# ðŸš€ LangGraph Demos & Patterns

This repository is a **hands-on playground** for exploring [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph) through practical examples and demos.  
Each example highlights a different **agent pattern** or **graph design**, ranging from simple RAG to multi-tool orchestration.

> **LangGraph** = a framework for building **stateful, controllable LLM workflows** using graphs of nodes + edges, on top of LangChain.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of This Repo

- Learn **how LangGraph works** through incremental demos
- Explore **different retrieval strategies** (single query, multi-query, fusion)
- Practice **tool orchestration** with Reason â†’ Act â†’ Reason loops
- Experiment with **stateful conversations & memory**
- Add **guardrails, debugging, and tracing** for safer agents
- Serve as a **reference repo**
